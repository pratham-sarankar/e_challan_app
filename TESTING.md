# Testing the Challan Types Global Provider

## Overview
This implementation adds a global provider (using `ChallanTypesCubit`) to load challan types at app startup, improving performance and eliminating duplicate API requests.

## Running Tests

### 1. Generate Mock Files
Before running tests, generate the mock files for testing:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This will generate `challan_types_cubit_test.mocks.dart` which is needed for the unit tests.

### 2. Run Unit Tests
Run the cubit tests to verify the implementation:

```bash
flutter test test/challan_types_cubit_test.dart
```

Or run all tests:

```bash
flutter test
```

## Manual Testing

### Test Scenario 1: First Time User (Not Logged In)
1. Clear app data or use a fresh install
2. Launch the app
3. Expected: App starts normally at login screen
4. Login with credentials
5. Navigate to "Add Challan" page
6. Expected: Challan types dropdown loads immediately (since they were preloaded in main.dart after login)

### Test Scenario 2: Returning User (Already Logged In)
1. Launch the app (with existing login token)
2. Expected: Challan types start loading in background during splash screen
3. Navigate to dashboard, then to "Add Challan" page
4. Expected: Challan types are already loaded, dropdown appears instantly without loading spinner

### Test Scenario 3: Network Error Handling
1. Turn off network connection
2. Launch the app (logged in)
3. Navigate to "Add Challan" page
4. Expected: Error message appears with "Retry" button
5. Turn on network connection
6. Tap "Retry" button
7. Expected: Challan types load successfully

### Test Scenario 4: Information Page
1. Navigate to "Rule Violation Info" page
2. Expected: List of challan types appears instantly (using same global cubit)
3. Verify no duplicate network requests in logs

## Verification Points

### Performance Improvements
- [ ] Challan types load only once at app startup (check network logs)
- [ ] Forms open instantly with preloaded data
- [ ] No loading spinner on "Add Challan" page when returning to it
- [ ] No duplicate API calls to `/challan-types` endpoint

### Error Handling
- [ ] Retry mechanism works when network fails
- [ ] App doesn't crash if challan types fail to load at startup
- [ ] User can manually retry from UI
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable

### Code Quality
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No compilation errors
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns in the app
- [ ] Documentation is clear

## Expected Log Output

When the app starts successfully, you should see logs similar to:

```
[ChallanTypesCubit] Loaded 5 challan types
[AddChallanPage] Using global cubit - state: ChallanTypesLoaded
[InformationPage] Using global cubit - state: ChallanTypesLoaded
```

When navigating between pages, you should NOT see duplicate:
```
[ApiService] GET http://your-api/challan-types -> 200
```

## Rollback Instructions

If issues are found, you can temporarily disable the global provider by:

1. Comment out the challan types initialization in `main.dart`:
```dart
// await _initializeChallanTypes();
```

2. The pages will fall back to loading challan types on-demand (the old behavior)

Note: This is not recommended as a permanent solution, but can be used as a quick fix while debugging.
